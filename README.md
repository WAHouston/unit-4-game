# unit-4-game
### This is an RPG-style game themed around wizards from across fiction.
#### Gameplay
* Players pick from four different playable characters and then choose their opponents from the remaining characters.
* Each character has different hitpoint and attack values.
* Enemy characters' attacks remain constant, while the player's attack value increases.
* When a player reduces an opponent's hitpoints to zero, they can choose a new opponent to fight.
* If a player's hitpoints are reduced to zero, the game is over and they must restart.
#### Purpose
* The unit-4 game demonstrates the ability to use jQuery and an understanding of scope.
